# @hornbeck/react-modals

This is a package for efficient and configurable way of handling modals.
The modals are promise based, meaning every modal is a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
This allows for you to not only not have to worry about the open / close state of the modal.
But also allow for the modals to be integrated seemlessly into your control flows.

```bash
npm install --save @hornbeck/react-modals
```
